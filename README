#ng-Drupal: An AngularJS Demo

A very simple AngularJS app to demonstrate connecting to Drupal7 Rest Services

- Retrieves a specific node from Drupal
- Retrieves a view from Drupal
- Uses $routeParams to display detail node

*** Drupal ***
Since this is not a Drupal demo I will not detail the Drupal setup here.

In brief, you will need to have a Drupal7 instance with the following modules:
- Services 7.x-3.1
- Views 7.x-3.3
- Services Views 7.x-1.0-beta1

You will need to configure A rest server endpoint 'api' and expose the necessary resources.

The demo also makes use of a view called 'blog_roll' which displays a list of blog posts (fields: title, body)
